# Ronnie Denzel Typescript React

Hello everyone, this is a repository dedicated to my progress in learning **react typescript**, which is a combination of the react library with the typescript language.

The progress follows the learning of **typescript**, which already has [its own repository.](https://github.com/itsbluejelly/Ronnie_Denzel_Typescript)

## Plans For Repository

As this is a repository based on the learning progress of [*TSX**](#tsx-typescript-jsx), i don't plan on updating it in the future unless future updates on the library and language both occur.

However, it can act as a memory bank for anyone, myself included, who wants to refresh their knowledge on the concept of react with typescript, as well as using vite.

## Project setup

The project is public and can be cloned by anyone, but aside from the first commit which occurs on the **main** branch, the other concepts of the language may be found in subsequent branches, that is if there are different concepts, as shown below:

>|   Branches    |  Commits  |
>|:------------: |---------: |
>| **Branch-01**  | Commit 1  |
>| **Branch-02**  | Commit 2  |
